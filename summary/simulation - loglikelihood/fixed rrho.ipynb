    "# Modelling and testing stem cell populations with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Stem cells maintain the structure of tissues and organs in the body. How they grow and divide is a subject of intensive study, but one concept has been explored heavily over the past decade and found to describe how the stem cell population is maintained in many different tissues.  In this tutorial we will give concrete examples of how to build simulators that explore how changing one part of the model alters cell growth, and compare the model behaviour against experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Schematic of single progenitor model](Cartoon.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to explore one part of the single progenitor model (depicted above). The model has two types of cell; stem cells and differentiated cells. Stem cells divide to give two daughter cells, which can either be one stem cell and one differentiated cell (asymmetric division), both stem cells, or both differentiated cells (symmetric division). As the population of stem cells is constant, the probability of both possible symmetric divisions is equal, so over time, on average, one stem cell gives one differentiated cell and one stem cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past the division (sometimes written as $\\lambda$) and stratification (sometimes written as $\\Gamma$) times have been modelled as following an exponential distribution. Recent experiments have suggested that this is inappropriate and may bias our analysis. Here we will build simulators that use more complex distributions and see how they change the model behaviour by both direct comparison with experimental data and by exploring the general properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document has a parallel document written in F#, performing the same functions using different available libraries. Where sensible functions with the same task have the same name. By referring to both of them you can see how similar tasks can be accomplished in both languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background biology\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst this tutorial has been written to focus on aspects of the maths and programming, the code and text necessarily use a few technical terms. This section introduces some of them and how they are used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *cell* is the basic unit of living matter- it eats, divides, dies, and carries out functions specific to the tissue its in. The cell *fate* is the cells function, and in this model is determined on birth. This dictates what that cell can go on to do in the future. In this model, one cell fate is to be a *stem cell*. Stem cells will go on to divide at some point in the future. The *cell cycle* is the process that immediate proceeds division. This is expected to last an average length of time for a given cell type, but the distribution of times is not necessarily known. The alternative cell fate in this model is to *differentiate*; in this case the cell will stop dividing, and eventually leave the space that stem cells occupy by a process called *stratification*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *clone* is the set of descendants from a single cell at a specific point in time. These could be defined by a natural event- such as a mutation- or a result of an experiment. A common experiment known as *lineage tracing* is to monitor the size of clones in growing tissues is to add an *inheritable*, permenant coloured label to cells at a specific timepoint. As the label is inheritable all of the cells in a clone will carry it, and can be distinguished and counted under a microscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of labelling experiment involves the use of a *histone* label. This label is switched on during the experiment similar to lineage tracing. However, the labelled histone stops being produced after the experiment is started, though cells continue to produce unlabelled histones. This means that every time the cell divides the amount of label halves, allowing cell divisions to be tracked over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document we will present code to do 4 different tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate cell fates to show how clones compete neutrally to dominate the tissue\n",
    "2. Take the results of those simulations and study the effect of different cell-cycle time distributions by generating random numbers taken from different distributions.\n",
    "3. Simulate an experiment where a label becomes more dilute every time a cell divides\n",
    "4. Use this simulator with an ''Approximate Bayesian Computation'' based analysis to find out which distribution best describes some collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In doing so we will look to report and plot data as a we go along to confirm that different parts of the code are working. Wherever possible we use external libraries to perform calculations rather than reimplement the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also specify a seed for random number generation for calculations. This is to help ensure repeatability."

    "# Simulating cell fates\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dendrograms of cell fates](CellFate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first behaviour we will simulate is fate determination of cells in a clone, starting from a single cell. This is the pattern of changing cell states as cells go on to divide. Examples of cell fates are drawn as dendrograms above. In (A), A cell divides, but neither daughter cell is a stem cell and so division stops. In (B), the divisions form a more complex (and unfinished pattern)- in the first division the cell fates are asymmetric giving one stem cell and one differentiated cell. That stem cell divides to give two stem cells, and so on until either all daughter cells in the clone divide becoming differentiated cells, or we stop the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific situation we are only simulating the fates- that is to say, we know that division and stratification occur at different rates, but we are not taking account of that yet- we just record the order in which things happened in discrete time. Even without precise timings we expect the functions to give us some of the key properties of the clone growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "We define a clone through a record type, where we record when the clone was born (*birthtime*), when the cell left the clone (*lifeTime*), the random number generator used to determine the next fate (*rng*), whether the cell is a stem cell (*stem*) and the probability of dividing to give daughters with the same cell fate (*r*). We also include a list of other clones that the clone has given birth to (*sibling*), and an integer used to assign a unique identity to every cell created (*identity*). Note we have defined other elements in the record, which we use in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function *fateSimulate* simulates the life of a single cell. Given a clone record, a maximum number of divisions (*limit*), and a reference variable used to track unique identities (*idTrack*) it loops through events in the cells life, giving a final clone with some variables changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In each loop fateSimulate first tests whether the cell has been simulated enough times, and if it has returning a modified version of the last state of the cell. This is either the last state with the lifetime set to the current time (and a Boolean variable, *survivor*, set to true to indicate this), or if the cell is not a stem cell at the end of the simulation, the last state with the lifetime set to the current time+1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, if the cell is still a stem cell, it creates a new daughter cell as a copy of the parent, with a new unique identity value. We then determine using r and a random number whether the daughter and parent are stem cells after division, defining a new cell to replace the parent and the daughter. Finally, we restart the loop using the replacement cell with the daughter added to the list of siblings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This however is not sufficient- we want to simulate all the daugter cells as well to see how the clone grows. To do this we define a recursive function *cloneSimulateInternal*, which simulates a single cell, then recursively runs on all of the daughter cells (and their daughter cells and so on), appending only the key information as a tuple to list reference. This function itself is run through *cloneSimulate*, which sorts the final list by unique identifier (this is important for later functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function *experiment* is defined which takes a list of discrete timepoints, runs cloneSimulate, and asks how many cells are alive at each time."

    "The fate simulator is able to generate the orders of events in a clones lifetime, but in order to compare this with experimental data we need to use the outputs from that function, and transform them into floating point numbers that reflect the division and stratification rates. The most common way to do this is to draw the division times from an exponential distribution characterised by its mean, but we also know that the exponential distribution is unrealistic for cell division times. Here we explore two alternative distributions used in the literature; a short, deterministic delay (the delay or refractory period) followed by an exponential distribution, and a deterministic lag period followed by times selected from a gamma distribution (with an additional shape parameter). As the exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution where the shape is 1., we can focus on using just the gamma distribution when we start to compare with experimental data.\n",

    "We first define functions that allow us to set create a random number generator for a given distribution with a specific set of parameters (using the numpy library to generate the underlying distribution). In each case the overall mean time for events to occur and a random number generator is passed to the function. In addition to this, a delay may be passed (either as an absolute delay, or expressed as a fraction of the mean) and a shape parameter. In each case the object returned is a function that takes unit as an input and returns a new floating point number from the distribution.\n",

    "The function *correctTime* below takes two random number generator objects (of the type we have just defined above), an initial time, and an array of tuples generated by the cloneSimulate function defined above. It returns a new array with the time of birth and the time of loss of the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we first generate an array with random numbers drawn from the function representing the division times. If the cell stratifies we replace the last number in the array with a value drawn from the function representing stratification times. Finally, we perform a cumulative sum so that all elements represent the times taken for each event to happen from an initial timepoint (here arbitrarily set to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a series of timepoints that are accurate relative to the time when the cell was first born. However, we need the times to be relative to the start of the experiment to be useful. To do this for each cell we need to look at the times of its parent (and in turn, its parents and grandparents until the original cell) and adjust all the timepoints by the time the cell was born. Uniquely, the original cell has a parent set to a negative value and if this is found in the loop, the initial time is set to the value passed when calling the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we want to generate times for the third cell in a clone. The third cell is a daughter of the first. The discrete times are \n",
    "\n",
    "cell 1 born @ 0, lost @ 3\n",

    "For cell 3, assuming that the initial time of the experiment was 0 (so cell 1 remains unchanged), we then need to add 0.5 (the first time from cell 1) to every timepoint. We get this by using the discrete birthtime as an index in the array. Finally, we return the first and last elements of the new array as the time of birth and the time of death; 0.5 and 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relies on being able to look up the parent time. Earlier we sorted the array returned by cloneSimulate by the unique identifier- this allows us to use the parent id (stored in the tuple) as an index in the original search. It also ensures that we correct the times in order of cell creation- this is important as when we correct the times we mutate the values in the original array, and ensures that we have always corrected the parents before we update their children. \n",
